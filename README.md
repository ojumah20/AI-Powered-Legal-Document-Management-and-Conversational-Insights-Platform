This project involves developing an advanced API-driven platform that empowers legal teams to efficiently manage their legal documents. The system integrates a robust database for storing and organizing metadata, enabling seamless uploading, retrieval, and tracking of documents. Leveraging state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs), the platform provides automated summarization of legal texts, reducing time spent on manual reviews.

Additionally, it features an intelligent conversational interface, allowing users to interact with the system using natural language to query, analyze, and gain insights from uploaded documents. By incorporating cutting-edge concepts like metadata-driven architecture, MLOps for model deployment, and secure API design, this solution ensures scalability, precision, and ease of use for modern legal practices.
